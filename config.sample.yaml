# Sample Configuration Template
# Copy this to config.yaml and customize for your environment

servers:
  # Server 1 - Example production server with SSH key authentication
  - name: "Production Web Server"
    host: "192.168.1.100"
    username: "ubuntu"
    auth_method: key
    key_path: "~/.ssh/production-key.pem"

  # Server 2 - Example database server with SSH key
  - name: "Database Server"
    host: "192.168.1.101"
    username: "ubuntu"
    auth_method: key
    key_path: "~/.ssh/production-key.pem"

  # Server 3 - Example with different key
  - name: "Development Server"
    host: "dev.example.com"
    username: "developer"
    auth_method: key
    key_path: "~/.ssh/dev-key.pem"

  # Server 4 - Example with password authentication
  # Password will be prompted at startup for security
  # Passwords are NEVER saved to this config file - only stored in memory during runtime

    host: "server.example.com"
    username: "your_username"
    auth_method: password  # Will prompt for password at startup

# Monitoring Configuration
monitoring:
  # How often to poll CPU data from servers (seconds)
  # Lower = more real-time, Higher = less network traffic
  poll_interval: 2.0

  # How often to refresh the UI display (seconds)
  # Should be <= poll_interval for smooth updates
  ui_refresh_interval: 0.5

  # Time window for CPU history graph (seconds)
  # This determines how many seconds of history to display
  history_window: 60

  # SSH connection timeout (seconds)
  connection_timeout: 10

  # Maximum number of connection retry attempts
  max_retries: 3

  # Delay between retry attempts (seconds)
  retry_delay: 5

# Display Configuration
display: {}
